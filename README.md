# Apache Log Parser
## Info
### Requirements
- Python 3.5 (if running from source)

You can also download a Windows build from: https://familie-mol.nl/public/LogParser.zip

### Configuration options
- Debugging on or off, let's you choose to show or hide all logging and information notifications.
- Results file, let's you enter the path and/or filename of the results file. (Output is HTML, but HTML is not the required extension!)
- Log File, let's you enter the path/or filename of the log file that will be loaded in the tool.
- Exit Mode, let's you choose if you want the tool to close when the results are ready or go back to main menu.

If a config change required a restart of the tool, "Restart and go back to main menu" is shown instead of "Go back to main menu".
